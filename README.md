# Flask Chat App

A messaging web app created to leverage skills I've learned. Front-end created using HTML/CSS, Bootstraps, and Javascript. Back-end created using Flask. Front-end and back-end connected by Websockets and AJAX.

## Features
* **Sending Messages:** messages sent in real time displaying sender name, contents, and timestamp.
* **Channels:** users can go into different channels to message different users.
* **Remembering:** remembers the last channel opened by a user when closed and reopens channel upon logging in again.
